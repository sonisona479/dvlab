The Titanic was a British passenger liner that famously sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City in April 1912 after hitting an iceberg. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown:

The Ship
Construction: Built by the White Star Line, it was considered unsinkable due to its advanced safety features.

Size and Capacity: One of the largest ships of its time, capable of carrying over 2,200 passengers and crew.

The Voyage
Departure: Left Southampton on April 10, 1912, making stops in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland.

Iceberg Collision: Struck an iceberg on the night of April 14, 1912, at around 11:40 PM.

The Sinking
Impact: The collision caused the ship's hull plates to buckle, allowing water to flood into the lower compartments.

Evacuation: There were not enough lifeboats for all passengers due to outdated maritime safety regulations.

Rescue: The RMS Carpathia arrived and rescued 705 survivors.

Casualties
Loss of Life: Over 1,500 people perished, making it one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history.

Survivors: Many survivors suffered from hypothermia due to the frigid waters of the North Atlantic.

Legacy
Investigations: Prompted changes in maritime laws, including the requirement for sufficient lifeboats for all passengers and the establishment of the International Ice Patrol.

Cultural Impact: Inspired numerous books, films, and documentaries, including James Cameron's 1997 film "Titanic."
